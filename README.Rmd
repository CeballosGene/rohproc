## Package Overview

The analysis of autozygosity through the Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) --contiguous regions of the genome where an individual is homozygous across all sites-- is an alternative and relatively new approach to answer many important questions in modern genetics, including population history and the genetic architecture of complex traits.

This package provides with several useful functions to represent and analyze PLINK's ROH outcomes. The following script in bash is recommended to search of ROH in humans. The following PLINK's conditions are optimal for ROH searching in humans when a minimun of 1.5M SNP is used.

<pre><code>plink  \
  --bfile path/to/bfile \
  --homozyg-window-snp 30 \
  --homozyg-window-het 1 \
  --homozyg-snp 30 \
  --homozyg-kb 300 \
  --homozyg-density 30 \
  --out path/to/folder
</code></pre>

This bash script will generate a .hom file with all the information needed. This package takes that tabular file and process it to obtain different summary outcomes, figures and other features.

### Data avaliable with this package
This package includes .hom file with the PLINK's ROH analysis of 19 populations belonging to the [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/).

## Processing .hom files
First three functions avaliable in this package are useful to first process the PLINK's .hom file. 

## Population Genetics.
### ROH distribution

### Searching for the Origin of the inbreeding
Two distinct and independent biological scenarios can increase homozygosity in natural populations: cultural consanguinity and genetic drift in isolated populations. These two different sources were defined in classical population genetics as systematic inbreeding (denoted by FIS) and panmictic  nbreeding (denoted by FST), respectively. Total inbreeding, denoted by FIT, is defined by (1-FIT) = (1-FIS) (1-FST)
Panmictic inbreeding occurs in isolated populations, when individuals randomly mate within their own group, with no immigration. Population isolation can be cultural, a consequence of geographical barriers or because of sedentary behavior. Importantly, isolation by itself does not create genomic autozygosity, except when the effective population size (Ne) is small and genetic drift has the strength to remove genetic variability. On the other hand, systematic inbreeding, or cultural consanguinity, has the effect of reducing heterozygosity relative to the expectation under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium independent of Ne, and thus increasing FIS. High consanguinity (and consequent high FIS), and genetic drift by isolation coupled with low Ne (and consequent high FST) are two independent and non-mutually-exclusive phenomena that can increase overall autozygosity (FIT) in a population. Here we also note that the term ‘‘endogamy’’ is generally used to describe population isolation, although the term is sometimes used to refer to consanguinity.

> -   *Number of ROH vs Sum of ROH* Wwe may assess the origins of the autozygosity using comparisons of NROH>1.5Mb and SROH>1.5Mb. Namely, if an individual displays excess of SROH>1.5Mb relative to NROH>1.5Mb in comparison to non-consanguineous individuals, this suggests autozygosity by consanguinity. If both SROH>1.5Mb and NROH>1.5Mb are high, this suggests drift-driven autozygosity. This approach does not provide a quantitative estimation of the elative contributions of drift versus consanguinity, but only a qualitative assessment. Nevertheless, it is a powerful approach: its inferences on autozygosity patterns in modern human populations’ genomes are consistent with known ethnographic data about consanguineous traditions, and about population size and isolation.Simulations of the number and sum of ROHs, for ROH > 1.5 Mb, calculated for the offspring of different consanguineous matings can be shown, along with the ancient and modern samples. Points with different colors designate offspring of different consanguineous mating: second cousin (green), first cousin (yellow), avuncular (uncle-niece, aunt-nephew, double first cousin) (orange), incest (brother-sister, parent-offspring) (red). Five thousand simulations are represented for each consanguineous mating. Note that this simulation does not include drift, but the degree of right shift can be projected to cases where there exists a non-zero level of autozygosity due to drift
